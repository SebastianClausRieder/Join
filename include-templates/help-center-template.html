        <span class="help-text font-inter">
            Join is a visual system for managing work throughout a process.<br>
            Join visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work that goes through that process.<br>
            The goal of Kanban is to identify and address potential bottlenecks in your process so work can proceed cost-effectively and at optimal speed or throughput.
